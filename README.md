## Overview


![screenshot](src/img/web.png)

In this demo the user can see the simple web site with content 404 not found, this page it`s used when the content are unavilable, or dose not exsit.

 My experience developing this project was awesome, becouse I`m new in the frontend development, and some time the people say that the backend is hard, but the frontend is very hard.

 Making this demo i learned how i can work with figma an following the step to focus in the main task, also i learned features realted to css, such as:
  - import external fonts
  - custom properties (variables in css)

I improved my skill with react.js framework and i lose the fear to make css code without any css framework.
